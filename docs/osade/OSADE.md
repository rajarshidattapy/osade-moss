## 0. What Osade is

Osade is a local-first desktop workspace for running multiple coding agents as **open-source
contributors** across real repositories.

The unit of value: **a row in the ledger is a live agent working an issue in an isolated
worktree, under a repo's own conventions, behind human-controlled gates.**

### 0.1 The design constraint that shapes everything

Open source in 2026 is actively closing the door on autonomous AI contributions. Godot banned
autonomous agent use outright. curl shut down its bug bounty. GitHub is exploring PR
restrictions. Maintainers report roughly 1 in 10 AI PRs meets their bar.

The bottleneck is **maintainer review capacity**, not code production. A tool that increases
agent PR volume makes the problem worse.

So Osade's design goal is not "more agent PRs." It is:

> **Reduce the maintainer's review cost per contribution to the point where an agent-assisted
> PR is cheaper to review than a human one.**

Every feature in this document is justified against that sentence. Features that only increase
throughput are deprioritized. Features that produce evidence, verification, provenance, and
scoped permission are prioritized. This is also the honest competitive moat: throughput is
commoditized, trust is not.

### 0.2 What we are joining together

| Source | What Osade takes | What Osade does not take |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Substrate** (Rust) | Entire execution substrate: PTYs, panes, tabs, layout, git worktrees, agent process detection, agent hook integrations, session persistence, live handoff, JSON API + event hub | Its TUI client; its ratatui rendering path |
| **Kanban / Cline** (TS) | Board-as-orchestrator model, narrow hook vocabulary, turn checkpoints, agent catalog shape, worktree hard-won rules, auto-review loop, multi-viewer backpressure | Its own PTY layer (the substrate owns that), its `node-pty`/xterm-headless mirror, the in-process SDK path |
| **AO** (Go) | Durable-facts/derived-status invariant, capability gating, reviewer filesystem gateway, CDC-single-event-path, orchestrator-as-an-agent-driving-our-own-CLI, state containment | Its Go daemon, its saga-based TUI↔chat handoff (deferred to M5+) |
| **New to Osade** | Repository conventions mining with citation, layered verification-gated memory, OSS lifecycle state machine, approval gates on public writes, org workspaces | — |

---

## 1. Non-goals

Do not build these. If a task seems to require one, stop and ask.

1. **Do not fork the substrate.** Extend it only through its documented extension points (JSON API
   `Method` variants, `distribution/agent-detection/*.toml`, `src/integration/assets/<agent>/`,
   plugins). If a patch is genuinely unavoidable it goes in `patches/` with a written rationale
   and an upstream issue link.
2. **Do not reimplement** PTY handling, VT parsing, terminal emulation, worktree creation, agent
   process detection, or session restore. the substrate does all of it.
   *Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #10.* **Carve-out:** Osade may run read-only and
   maintenance git commands in a repo or worktree — `git worktree prune`, `status`,
   `diff`, `rev-parse`, `stash`. the substrate never prunes before `worktree add`
   (`backend/src/worktree.rs:238-320`), so the "missing but already registered" failure is
   ours to prevent, and there is no git-status event to subscribe to (§7). What stays the substrate's
   is worktree *lifecycle*: create, open, remove.
3. **No auto-merge. Ever.** Osade never merges a PR.
4. **No agent-authored public write without a gate.** Comments, PRs, reviews, pushes — all gated.
5. **No hosted multi-tenant service.** Local-first, single user, one machine.
6. **No custom model or agent.** Osade is agent-agnostic; it drives whatever CLI the user has.
7. **No web-only build in v1.** Electron is the shell. Browser access is a later milestone.
8. **Do not build a bespoke agent-to-agent protocol.** See §17.

Three processes. Two of them survive the window closing.

**DECISION — why a separate daemon rather than putting domain logic in Electron main.**
Agents must survive the app quitting; so must GitHub polling, verification runs, and the
conventions miner. the substrate already survives client detach; the daemon must too, or half the
system dies when the user closes a window. It also gives us the `osade` CLI for free, which
is what agents use to coordinate (§17).

**DECISION — why the renderer talks to the substrate directly for surfaces.**
Proxying terminal cell frames through the daemon would create a second event path and add a
hop to the hottest loop in the system. The renderer holds two connections: domain state from
the daemon, cell surfaces from the substrate.

**DECISION — why a UtilityProcess for the substrate transport.**
Renderer cannot open unix sockets under `contextIsolation`. Routing frames through the main
process would put a 60fps stream behind the main IPC queue, which also serves menus and
dialogs. An Electron `utilityProcess` opens the socket, decodes frames, and is handed a
`MessageChannelMain` port straight to the renderer.

### 2.1 Network posture — INVARIANT

- Daemon binds `127.0.0.1` only. No `0.0.0.0` listener in v1.
- the substrate sockets are unix domain sockets, mode `0600` — **on Unix**.
  *Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #12.* On Windows they are **named pipes**, not files:
  `interprocess` maps the path string through `GenericNamespaced`
  (`backend/src/ipc.rs:44-51`), so a client connects to `\\.\pipe\C:\…\osade.sock` and access
  is governed by an SDDL descriptor (`backend/src/ipc.rs:156`), not a file mode. The `.sock`
  path also exists on disk as a marker file (`backend/src/ipc.rs:76`); **its presence does not
  mean a server is listening** — probe with `ping`.
- No unauthenticated route reachable off-loopback. There is no remote mode in v1.
- The daemon never holds a GitHub token in its config file. Tokens live in Electron
  `safeStorage` and are passed to the daemon at spawn over an fd/env handshake, held in memory
  only.

### 2.2 State containment — INVARIANT

Everything Osade writes lives under `~/.osade/`. Including Electron's `userData` — call
`app.setPath('userData', ~/.osade/electron)` before `app.whenReady()`. No
`~/Library/Application Support`, no `%APPDATA%`, ever. The whole system must be resettable
with `rm -rf ~/.osade`.

the substrate keeps its own `~/.config/substrate/` — that is the substrate's business, not ours. We point it at a
named session (`osade`) so we never collide with a user's own substrate session.

## 3. Naming — read this before writing any type

the substrate and Osade both use the word "workspace" for different things. This will cause bugs.

| Osade term | Definition | the substrate equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Org` | A GitHub org or a user-defined grouping of repos | none |
| `Repo` | One git repository on disk + its GitHub remote | none |
| `Task` | One unit of work. 1:1 with a worktree and a substrate workspace | `Workspace` |
| `Lane` | A role inside a task: `agent` / `verify` / `shell` / `review` | `Tab` |
| `Process` | A running program in a lane | `Pane` |

**Rule:** Osade code never says "workspace" unqualified. It says `Task` for its own concept and
`substrateWorkspaceId` when referring to the substrate's. The typed substrate client (§4.1) is the only place
the substrate's vocabulary appears.

---

## 4. Integration contract with the substrate

### 4.1 Generate the client, do not hand-write it — INVARIANT

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #1 and #2.*

**the substrate's version string is not a contract.** Two builds both call themselves `0.8.2` and
differ by protocol (20 vs 22), by ten methods, and by one capability field. Generating a
client from the wrong one produces calls the shipped binary answers with `invalid_request` —
not at boot, but the first time a user hits that code path.

So the identity of a substrate target is the tuple **(protocol number, method set)**. The version
string is a label.

**INVARIANT — the pinned vendored schema is the only codegen source.**

```
vendor/runtime/<version>-p<protocol>/
├── api-schema.json     captured with `osade-runtime api schema --json` from the vendored binary
├── methods.txt         the sorted method set, for diffing
├── pin.json            protocol, method count, schema sha256, binary sha256, known gaps
└── <target>/substrate      the binary itself (M0 packaging)
```

`backend/` is **reference reading for behaviour only, never a source of API derivation.** It
is an unreleased tree ahead of any binary Osade ships. Read it to understand what a method
*does*; never to learn that a method exists.

The upstream file OSADE.md previously named — the schema file under `docs/next/api/` — is
absent from `backend/` as vendored, and is `include_str!`'d at `backend/src/cli/api.rs:1`, so
that tree does not compile. Do not try to restore it. The binary embeds and prints its own
schema; that is the capture path.

**Milestone 0, task 1:** generate a typed TypeScript client from the pinned
`api-schema.json` (`json-schema-to-typescript` or `quicktype`) into
`packages/daemon/src/substrate/generated/`. Commit the generated output, the schema, and
`pin.json` together.

Do **not** hand-write method names from memory or from this document. This document names
methods illustratively; the pinned schema is the truth, and it has **91 methods** at
`0.8.2-p20`. If a method this spec assumes is not in the pinned schema, stop and report it
rather than approximating. Verified method names, event names and payload shapes live in
`docs/SUBSTRATE-CONTRACT.md`.

#### 4.1.1 The boot drift check — specification

A contract test, run both in CI and as a daemon boot guard. **Specification only; implement
in M0.**

*Input.* The pinned `api-schema.json` and `pin.json`; the schema of the binary actually about
to be used, obtained by executing `<binary> api schema --json`. Read it from the binary on
`PATH`/in `vendor/`, not from a cached copy — the point is to catch a user running a
different the substrate.

*Comparison.* Exactly three assertions, in this order:

| # | Assertion | On failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `live.protocol === pin.the substrate.protocol` | **fatal.** Refuse to start. |
| 2 | `methodSet(live) ⊇ methodSet(pin)` — every pinned method exists in the live binary | **fatal.** Name the missing methods. |
| 3 | `methodSet(live) \ methodSet(pin)` is empty | **warn only.** A superset is a newer the substrate; log the extra methods so a re-pin gets scheduled. |

*Explicitly not compared:* the **version string**. It is decorative and two different builds
share it. Never gate on it, never print it as the reason.

*Failure message* must name the drift, not the symptom:

```
substrate protocol mismatch: pinned 0.8.2-p20 expects protocol 20, binary at
  <path> reports protocol 22.
missing methods: (none)   unexpected methods: command.invoke, pane.scroll, +8
re-pin with: osade-runtime api schema --json > vendor/runtime/<version>-p<protocol>/api-schema.json
```

*Where it runs.* In CI as a test against the vendored binary; at daemon boot before the first
API call; and it must be cheap — one subprocess, one JSON parse, no socket. Assertion 3 must
never block a boot, or every the substrate upgrade becomes an outage.

*What it deliberately does not check.* The endpoint protocol generation, which is negotiated
separately and independently at handshake (§4.3), and the binary checksum, which `pin.json`
records but which cannot gate a user's own installed the substrate.

### 4.2 Which socket for what

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #6b and #7.*

| Need | Transport | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create/destroy worktrees, spawn agents, send prompts, query state | `osade.sock` JSON API | daemon only; one connection per call |
| Subscribe to agent status | `osade.sock` `events.subscribe` | daemon only; **one connection per pane** (§7) |
| Subscribe to workspace/tab/pane lifecycle | `osade.sock` `events.subscribe` | daemon only; one connection, global |
| Terminal cell content, semantic input | endpoint protocol, generation 1 | renderer utility process only — **deferred past M0**, see §4.4 |
| Git status / diff state | **not the substrate.** `git` in the worktree, debounced | no such event exists (§7); §1 carve-out |
| Anything else | — | there is nothing else |

**INVARIANT — the JSON API is one request per connection.** `handle_connection_with_stop`
reads exactly one line, dispatches, writes one response, and returns
(`backend/src/api/server.rs:154-300`). There is no multiplexing and no keep-alive. The
generated client opens a fresh connection per call. Do **not** build a correlation-id
multiplexer or a connection pool; there is nothing to multiplex.

Exceptions that hold a connection open: `events.subscribe` and `pane.graphics.stream`
(streaming); `events.wait`, `agent.wait`, `agent.prompt` with `wait`, and
`pane.wait_for_output` (block, then one response). Each connection is an OS thread on the substrate's
side (`backend/src/api/server.rs:90-100`), so prefer `agent.prompt` + `wait` over
prompt-then-poll, and keep the steady-state connection count proportional to live panes, not
to time.

**INVARIANT:** `packages/daemon/src/substrate/**` is the only directory permitted to import the
generated substrate client or open `osade.sock`. Enforced by lint (§20).

### 4.3 The endpoint protocol — treat generation 1 as a floor

the substrate's `src/protocol/endpoint.rs` defines a separately versioned JSON handshake for
client-owned shells, deliberately independent of the private same-install bincode protocol,
because those clients may be a different build. Osade's Electron app is exactly that case: it
updates on its own cadence.

Codecs are immutable: `shell.snapshot.v1`, `shell.surface.v1`, `shell.input.semantic.v1`,
`shell.blob.v1`. New server capabilities arrive as *advertised methods* — a missing method
disables one action, never the whole connection. Write the transport to degrade that way.

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #3a.* **The stability promise is real; the framing is
not JSON.**

What generation 1 actually guarantees: `do_handshake` compares `generation` and the four
codec names and **never compares the substrate build versions**
(`backend/src/client/handshake.rs:219-232`). An Osade shell built against generation 1 keeps
working across the substrate upgrades. That part of §4.3 was right.

What it does not guarantee: the wire. The endpoint rides on `osade-client.sock`, framed

```
[u32 little-endian length][bincode payload]        backend/src/protocol/wire.rs:1592-1602
```

encoding the Rust enums `ClientMessage` / `ServerMessage` under
`bincode::config::standard()`. Only the handshake and control messages carry JSON, as a
string inside `EndpointControl { kind, data }`. Everything Osade would render —
`ClientShellSnapshot`, `PaneSurface(PaneSurfaceFrame)`, `PaneSurfacePatch` — is a native
bincode variant (`backend/src/protocol/wire.rs:1411`, `:1414`, `:1442`).

Two consequences. A TypeScript client must implement a bincode decoder for the whole
`ServerMessage` enum. And enum tags are **positional**, so a substrate build that inserts a
variant shifts every tag after it and the decoder misreads silently. `EndpointControl` is
append-only for exactly this reason (`wire.rs:1444-1448`); nothing else is. Any transport
built on this must pin to the vendored substrate (§4.1) and assert a known frame decodes at boot.

This is why the embedded terminal is deferred (§4.4).

### 4.4 Rendering terminal surfaces — DECISION, REVERSED

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #3b and #3c. This section previously specified a canvas
cell renderer for M0. That decision is reversed; the reasoning that produced it was sound but
rested on three facts that turned out to be false.*

**DECISION: M0 ships no embedded terminal.** Osade renders the ledger, task detail, diffs,
verification output and gates. Watching a live terminal is "Open in the substrate", which attaches a
real substrate client to the `osade` session in the user's own terminal.

#### What changed

The old decision rested on: the surfaces arrive as already-parsed cell grids (true), over a
JSON-ish protocol (**false** — bincode, §4.3), one stream per pane that the renderer can place
in its own layout (**false**), with a `TerminalAnsi` fallback available if canvas proved slow
(**false**).

- `PaneSurfaceFrame` (`backend/src/protocol/wire.rs:1213-1225`) is **one composited cell grid
  for a whole tab**, with `panes: PaneSurfacePane[]` giving each pane's rect inside it. the substrate
  composites; the client blits. There is no "subscribe to pane X's cells". Osade cannot
  assemble 15 panes from different tasks into its own React grid.
- Each connection does carry its own workspace/tab projection
  (`ClientConnection.shell_location`, `backend/src/server/clients.rs:174-175`), so N surfaces
  means N connections, N server-side render targets, and the substrate rendering N tabs per frame —
  the multiplicative path the substrate's own `AGENTS.md` warns about. "15 panes at 60fps" was never
  15 panes; it was 15 tabs.
- The `TerminalAnsi` fallback does not exist for endpoint clients. `RenderEncoding`
  (`wire.rs:41-48`) is negotiated on the **private** `TerminalHello` path;
  `do_handshake` hardcodes `SemanticFrame` for every endpoint shell
  (`backend/src/client/handshake.rs:236-238`).

#### Why this does not cost M0 anything

M0's acceptance criterion (§21) is that a row moves `queued → implementing → needs_input →
awaiting_review` driven entirely by the substrate's detection, with nothing polled. That was verified
end-to-end with **no client attached and no cell ever rendered** (`docs/SUBSTRATE-CONTRACT.md`
§3.3). Terminal pixels were never the thing M0 proves.

What a user actually needs to read during a task is verification output and diffs — files
Osade owns on disk (`~/.osade/runs/`), not the substrate cells.

#### What M0 does instead

- **Ledger, task detail, diff view, verification log tails, gates.** All from the daemon.
- **Activity line** from `AgentInfo.terminal_title_stripped`, which the substrate already reports on
  every status change — observed as `"Pong response"` after a turn. Free.
- **On-demand transcript panel** via `pane.read`, the one screen-content method the pinned
  schema exposes (§4.4.1). On explicit user action or a slow refresh, never a render loop.
- **"Open in the substrate"**, which runs `osade-runtime session attach osade` (or `osade-runtime --session osade`) in
  the user's terminal. Zero Osade rendering code, full fidelity, real input.

**INVARIANT — attaching a client mutates the substrate state that Osade derives status from.**
`agent_status` is `done` when the pane is idle **and unseen**, and `idle` when it is idle and
seen (`backend/src/app/api_helpers.rs:100-106`). `seen` is set by `pane.focus`
(`backend/src/app/api/panes.rs:477`), `agent.focus` (`backend/src/app/agents.rs:82`), and by a
client reporting terminal focus (`backend/src/server/headless.rs:858`). So opening a task in
the substrate flips `done → idle` and would erase §6 row 10 if Osade treated `idle` as a transition.
It does not — `idle` is never a transition (§6.1, §7). And **Osade never calls `pane.focus` or
`agent.focus` on a task lane**, because doing so would silently clear its own
`awaiting_review`.

#### 4.4.1 `pane.read` — the only screen content in the pinned schema

```
pane.read  { pane_id, source: "visible"|"recent"|"recent_unwrapped"|"detection",
             lines?: uint32 (capped at 1000), format: "text"|"ansi", strip_ansi: bool }
        →  { pane_id, workspace_id, tab_id, source, format,
             text: string, revision: uint64, truncated: bool }
```

`agent.read` is the same call keyed by agent `target`. Plain text, or an ANSI byte stream with
`format:"ansi"` + `strip_ansi:false`. **Not a structured cell grid**: no cursor position, no
cursor shape, no selection, no scroll offset. `pane.selection.read`, `pane.scroll` and
`pane.edit_scrollback` are **not in the pinned schema** — they are three of the ten methods in
the `0.8.2-p20` gap (§4.1).

Use it for a static panel at ≤1 Hz, keyed on `revision` to skip unchanged reads. Do not build
a render loop on it: one request is one connection is one the substrate thread (§4.2), the response is
the whole screen with no diffing, and there is no cursor to draw.

#### When the embedded terminal comes back

**M1, behind an explicit gate**, and only if the ledger has shipped and users ask for it. The
work is: a bincode decoder for `ServerMessage` pinned to the vendored substrate, with a boot
assertion that a known frame decodes; one endpoint connection per visible surface, **LRU-capped
at 3**; canvas 2D with damage tracking; kitty graphics rendered as a placeholder block. Write
the ADR when the gate opens, and re-derive the frame-rate target from tabs, not panes.

### 4.5 Do not violate the substrate's own invariants

Osade is a client. the substrate's `AGENTS.md` rules bind our integration:

- Presentation state (our ledger layout, colors, selection) is **ours**, never pushed into
  the substrate's state or API.
- If we need a new shared runtime fact, it goes in the substrate's server state and JSON API with a
  neutral name — never a UI name like `card`, `row`, `column`.
- Never add behavior reachable only through the private bincode socket.

### 5.2 Facts — INVARIANT: these are the only durable truth

**Nothing display-shaped is ever stored.** There is no `status` column on `task`. Status is a
pure function over the rows below, recomputed at read time (§6). This is AO's central invariant
and the single most important rule in this document.

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #4, #5 and #11.*

```sql
-- last known agent activity, written by substrate event subscriber
CREATE TABLE agent_fact (
  task_id       TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES task(id),
  substrate_pane_id TEXT,                      -- 'w3:p2'; the subscription key (§7)
  substrate_state   TEXT,                      -- working|blocked|done|idle|unknown
  last_event    TEXT,                      -- to_in_progress|to_review|activity
  last_event_at INTEGER,
  activity_text TEXT,                      -- from AgentInfo.terminal_title_stripped
  tool_name     TEXT,                      -- null for claude/codex — no source (§7)
  final_message TEXT,                      -- null for claude/codex — no source (§7)
  agent_session_id TEXT,                   -- from AgentInfo.agent_session, for resume
  pane_alive    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,

  probe_failures INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  terminated    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   -- explicit, not inferred
  state_change_seq INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, -- monotonic gate, §5.4.1 — INVARIANT
  controller_generation INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

Notes on three columns that will otherwise be got wrong:

- **`activity_text` / `tool_name` / `final_message`.** the substrate's bundled hooks report *state*
  for only six agents (pi, opencode, kimi, kilo, omp, mastracode). For **claude and codex the
  hook posts a session id and nothing else**, and no bundled asset calls
  `pane.report_metadata` at all. So `tool_name` and `final_message` have no source for the
  agents Osade leads with. Treat them as nullable-and-usually-null in v1 and drive the display
  string from `AgentInfo.terminal_title_stripped`, which the substrate reports on every status change.
- **`state_change_seq`.** The monotonic write gate. See §5.4.1.
- **`substrate_workspace_id`** on `task` is a durable key: it is a stored field
  (`backend/src/app/ids.rs:15-17`), stable when other workspaces close and across a substrate
  restart. Two cautions — `WorkspaceInfo.number` **does** renumber, so never key on it; and
  `parse_workspace_id` has a positional fallback for bare integers
  (`backend/src/app/ids.rs:60-67`), so always send the full `wN` form the substrate returned.

);
```

**INVARIANT — a failed probe is a fact, not a death certificate.** `probe_failures` and
`fetch_failed_at` are recorded; they never by themselves mark a task terminated. `terminated`
is set only by an explicit process-exit event or an explicit user action. This is the specific
bug AO calls out: a flaky liveness check killing a live agent.

  superseded_by TEXT REFERENCES memory(id)
);

CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE memory_vec USING vec0(
  memory_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding FLOAT[768]
);
```

### 5.4 Change data capture — INVARIANT: one event path

Every table above gets `AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` triggers writing a row into `change_log`.
A poller tails it with a watermark, decodes into typed events, and fans them to WS subscribers.

```sql
CREATE TABLE change_log (
  seq        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  table_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  row_id     TEXT NOT NULL,
  op         TEXT NOT NULL,
  at         INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

There is **no second event path**. No service emits a WS message directly. If the UI did not
update, the mutation did not go through the database, and that is the bug. Clients get a
`snapshot` on connect and a discriminated union of pushes after; the client never polls.

Retain the last 50k rows; prune on a timer.

### 5.4.1 The monotonic fact gate — INVARIANT

*Added 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #5.*

§5.4 governs Osade's *own* event path, which is exactly-once and ordered. the substrate's is neither.

the substrate's `EventHub` is a **512-entry in-memory ring buffer** (`backend/src/api/event_hub.rs:13`,
`:22`) polled per subscription. Two verified behaviours:

1. **Replay on connect.** A fresh `events.subscribe` connection immediately receives a burst
   describing state that existed before it connected — including `workspace_created` for a
   workspace that had already been *closed*. Reproduced on two independent connections.
2. **Silent loss.** More than 512 events while disconnected and the overflow is dropped with
   no gap marker. **The delivered envelope carries no sequence number.**

So a naive subscriber can write a replayed `working` on top of a live `done`, and can miss a
transition entirely without knowing.

> **INVARIANT — every agent fact write is gated on a monotonic counter, and every
> (re)connect reconciles against a snapshot.**
>
> 1. Each **state change** carries the counter from its payload:
>    `AgentInfo.state_change_seq`, or `PaneInfo.revision` where that is what the event gives. A
>    state change whose counter is **not strictly greater** than the stored
>    `agent_fact.state_change_seq` is **dropped**, not merged.
> 1a. **Only state changes participate in the gate.** A payload that carries no state — an
>    `agent_session` binding, say — neither consults nor advances the counter. Letting one
>    advance the watermark makes the fold order-dependent: a binding stamped with a high
>    sequence swallows every status event below it and strands the fact at whatever it happened
>    to hold. That is the same class of bug as a replayed `working` clobbering a live `done`,
>    entered from the other side. *Found by the §20.2 ordering property test during M0, not by
>    reading; keep that test.*
> 2. The counter and the fact it guards are written in **one transaction**. A fact stored
>    without advancing the counter, or a counter advanced without the fact, both reintroduce
>    the bug.
> 3. On every subscriber connect **and reconnect**, the daemon calls `session.snapshot`,
>    reconciles all live panes against it, and only then trusts the stream.
> 4. Reconciliation writes go through the database like every other write. §5.4 is not
>    weakened: there is still exactly one path from a mutation to the UI.

This is a *read* of the substrate on reconnect, not the polling §5.4 forbids: it is bounded, one call
per connection event, and it never drives the UI directly.

The same discipline covers §5.2's failed-probe rule from the other side. A dropped event is
not evidence that an agent died, exactly as a failed probe is not. Neither may set
`terminated`.

### 5.5 The contract package — INVARIANT

`packages/contract/` holds Zod schemas for **everything crossing a process boundary**: daemon↔
renderer, daemon↔CLI, daemon↔hook subprocess. tRPC procedures declare `.output(schema)`, so
renderer types are derived and never hand-written. Nothing crosses a boundary untyped.

Optimistic concurrency: any client-initiated mutation of a mutable aggregate carries
`expectedRevision`; a mismatch returns a typed conflict, never a silent overwrite.

---

## 6. Derived status — the core invariant

**INVARIANT: status is a pure function over facts, recomputed on every read. It is never
stored, never cached in the database, and never sent from the client.**

```ts
// packages/daemon/src/domain/derive-status.ts
// Pure. No I/O. No clock reads except the injected `now`. Fully unit-testable.
export function deriveStatus(f: TaskFacts, now: number): TaskStatus
```

Evaluate in order; first match wins. Order matters and is deliberate.

| # | Condition | Status | UI meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `scm.pr_state === 'merged'` | `merged` | Done. Archive candidate. |
| 2 | `task.archived_at != null` | `archived` | Hidden by default |
| 3 | An undecided `gate_request` exists | `awaiting_approval` | **Needs you.** Top of ledger. |
| 4 | `agent.substrate_state === 'blocked'` | `needs_input` | **Needs you.** |
| 5 | `scm.review_state === 'changes_requested'` or `unresolved_threads > 0` | `review_changes_requested` | **Needs you or the agent.** |
| 6 | `scm.checks_state === 'failure'` | `ci_failed` | |
| 7 | Latest required `verify_run` for current head has `exit_code != 0` | `verify_failed` | |
| 8 | A `verify_run` is open (`finished_at == null`) | `verifying` | |
| 9 | `scm.pr_state === 'open'` | `pr_open` | |
| 10 | `agent.last_event === 'to_review'` and no newer `to_in_progress` | `awaiting_review` | **Needs you.** |
| 11 | `agent.substrate_state === 'working'` | `implementing` | |
| 12 | `agent.terminated === 1` | `stopped` | |
| 13 | `agent.pane_alive === 0` and no the substrate workspace | `queued` | |
| 14 | otherwise | `idle` | |

Notes that will otherwise be got wrong:

- Rows 3–5 and 10 form the **needs-you set**. The ledger sorts on it. That set is the entire
  product for a user running eight agents.
- `verify_failed` is scoped to `head_sha`. A verify failure against an older commit is stale
  and does not gate.
- `probe_failures > 0` appears nowhere in this table. It surfaces as a small degraded-confidence
  badge in the UI, and nothing else.
- *Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #11.* **A substrate restart is not a task death.** the substrate
  restores workspaces, tabs and panes with the same ids and cwd, but **not the agent
  process**: the pane comes back as a bare shell with `agent = null` and
  `agent_status = unknown`. Row 13 must therefore read *`agent.pane_alive === 0` **or** the
  pane exists with no agent bound* → `queued`, so a restored-but-unlaunched task sorts as
  work to start rather than falling through to row 14 `idle`. `terminated` stays untouched —
  §5.2's rule holds: only an explicit process exit or an explicit user action sets it. §8.2
  owns the relaunch.
- *Per PRD-DELTA #4.* Row 10's trigger is `last_event === 'to_review'`, which now comes from
  the substrate's `done` and **only** from `done`. See §6.1.
- Never write a helper that persists the result of `deriveStatus`. If you find yourself wanting
  to index on status, index on the underlying facts instead.

### 6.1 The narrow event vocabulary — INVARIANT

Exactly three internal agent events, borrowed from Kanban because the discipline is correct:

```
to_in_progress   |   to_review   |   activity
```

Every agent's richer event vocabulary is mapped down to these by its adapter. `activity` is
**never** a transition; it only updates `activity_text` / `tool_name`. Adding a fourth event
requires changing this document first.

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #9.* The mapping from the substrate's five statuses onto these
three events — this replaces the collapsed `done`/`idle` row that appeared in §7:

| `AgentStatus` | Osade event | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `working` | `to_in_progress` | |
| `done` | `to_review` | the turn finished — this is the needs-you signal |
| `blocked` | *none* — sets `substrate_state` only | drives §6 row 4 `needs_input` |
| `idle` | *none* — sets `substrate_state` only | **never a transition**, in either direction |
| `unknown` | *none* — recorded, not acted on | |

`done` and `idle` are not interchangeable, and the difference is not about the agent.
`agent_status` is `done` when the pane is idle **and unseen**, `idle` when it is idle and
**seen** (`backend/src/app/api_helpers.rs:100-106`). So a completed turn reads `done` until
something marks the pane seen, at which point the substrate emits `idle` for the same agent in the
same state.

That is why `idle` must be inert. If `idle` mapped to `to_in_progress`, opening a task in
the substrate would silently clear its `awaiting_review`; if it mapped to `to_review`, a freshly
launched, never-prompted agent would land in the needs-you set immediately. Both were live
possibilities in the original table. A task leaves `queued` on `pane_alive` and a bound agent
(§6 row 13), not on an `idle` event.

See §4.4 for the corollary: Osade never calls `pane.focus` or `agent.focus` on a task lane.

The transition reducer is pure, in `packages/daemon/src/domain/agent-reducer.ts`, and takes
`(facts, event) -> factPatch`. No I/O in it.

---

## 7. Where agent state actually comes from

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #4, #6, #6a, #6b and #9. Four of the seven event names
this section originally used do not exist. The corrected surface, with payload shapes and
citations, is `docs/SUBSTRATE-CONTRACT.md` §7.*

**Do not build a parallel hook system.** the substrate installs per-agent hook scripts
(`backend/src/integration/assets/<agent>/`) and panes identify themselves via
`<prefix>_ENV`, `<prefix>_SOCKET_PATH`, `<prefix>_BIN_PATH`, `<prefix>_PANE_ID`, `<prefix>_TAB_ID` and
`<prefix>_WORKSPACE_ID`, injected at spawn (`backend/src/pane.rs:115-137`) — that much was right.

But the hooks report less than this section assumed. **The three names used here —
`HookStateReported`, `HookMetadataReported`, `AgentSessionReported` — are not events.** They
are *inbound methods* the hook scripts call (`pane.report_agent`,
`pane.report_metadata`, `pane.report_agent_session`), and what reaches a subscriber is the
status change the substrate derives from them.

### 7.1 What the hooks actually report

| Reports state (`pane.report_agent`) | Reports a session id only | Nothing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pi, opencode, kimi, kilo, omp, mastracode | **claude**, **codex**, cursor, copilot, devin, droid, grok, antigravity | hermes, qodercli, qwen |

**No bundled asset calls `pane.report_metadata` at all.** For claude and codex the hook fires
once on `SessionStart` and posts a session id and transcript path — nothing more. Their status
therefore comes **entirely from the substrate's screen-detection manifests**, which the live test
showed carrying the full lifecycle correctly (`blocked → idle → working → done`) with no
flapping. See §8.1 for the capability consequence.

### 7.2 The subscriber is an N+1 connection manager — INVARIANT

`events.subscribe` has two families of subscription
(`backend/src/api/schema/events.rs:16-85`), and agent status is only in the second:

- **Global, no parameters:** `workspace.*`, `worktree.*`, `tab.*`, `pane.created`,
  `pane.closed`, `pane.updated`, `pane.focused`, `pane.moved`, `pane.exited`,
  `pane.agent_detected`, `layout.updated`.
- **Pane-scoped, `pane_id` required:** `pane.agent_status_changed`, `pane.output_matched`,
  `pane.scroll_changed`. Omitting `pane_id` is a hard `invalid_request`.

**`pane.updated` is not a status feed.** It is emitted only on agent-name change and a few
unrelated actions (`backend/src/app/api.rs:631-633` and four other call sites), while
`pane.agent_status_changed` is emitted on every transition (`backend/src/app/api.rs:647-673`).
Verified: a global `pane.updated` subscription held across a complete `working → done` turn
received **zero** events for that turn.

> **INVARIANT — `packages/daemon/src/substrate/event-subscriber.ts` is a connection manager, not
> a socket.** It holds **one** global lifecycle connection plus **one connection per live
> agent pane**. A pane-status connection is opened when `pane.created` or a successful
> `agent.start` yields a pane id, and closed on `pane.exited` / `pane.closed`. Steady-state
> connection count is proportional to live panes; ~15 concurrent tasks is ~16 connections,
> each an OS thread on the substrate's side.

Every write from either connection passes the monotonic gate in §5.4.1, and every connect and
reconnect reconciles against `session.snapshot` first.

### 7.3 The corrected mapping

| the substrate event | Osade fact write |
| --- | --- |
| `pane.agent_status_changed` → `working` | `substrate_state='working'`, event `to_in_progress` |
| `pane.agent_status_changed` → `blocked` | `substrate_state='blocked'` (drives `needs_input`) |
| `pane.agent_status_changed` → `done` | `substrate_state='done'`, event `to_review` |
| `pane.agent_status_changed` → `idle` | `substrate_state='idle'` — **no transition** (§6.1) |
| `pane.agent_status_changed` → `unknown` | `substrate_state='unknown'` — no transition |
| its `title` / `display_agent` / `state_labels` fields | `activity_text` — event `activity` |
| `pane.agent_detected` | binds `agent` label to the pane; `released` clears it |
| `pane.exited` | `pane_alive=0`; `terminated=1` only on an explicit process exit |
| `AgentInfo.agent_session` (via snapshot / `agent.get`) | `agent_session_id`, for resume |

Payload of the one that matters, as observed live:

```json
{"event":"pane.agent_status_changed",
 "data":{"pane_id":"w3:p2","workspace_id":"w3","agent_status":"working","agent":"claude"}}
```

with optional `title`, `display_agent`, `state_labels` when non-empty.

### 7.4 Names this section used that do not exist

| Was written as | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| `HookStateReported` | inbound method `pane.report_agent`; surfaces as `pane.agent_status_changed` |
| `HookMetadataReported` | inbound method `pane.report_metadata`; nothing bundled calls it |
| `AgentSessionReported` | inbound method `pane.report_agent_session`; surfaces as `AgentInfo.agent_session` |
| `PaneDied` | the event is `pane.exited`, payload `{pane_id, workspace_id}` |
| `GitStatusRefreshed` | **does not exist, under any name.** `EventKind` is closed at `backend/src/api/schema/events.rs:194-221` |

**Git status is Osade's.** There is no git event to subscribe to, so the daemon runs
`git -C <worktree> status --porcelain` / `diff --stat` itself, debounced, triggered by
verification runs and by `pane.agent_status_changed → done`. This is the §1 carve-out, not a
violation of it: the substrate owns worktree *lifecycle*, not reading a directory.

### 7.5 If a signal is genuinely missing

Extend the substrate properly: a new declarative rule in `backend/distribution/agent-detection/*.toml`
(21 agents, versioned, remotely updatable via `index.toml`), or a new `Method`/event in
`src/api/schema/`. Do not screen-scrape terminal output from Osade. the substrate's detector reads the
bottom buffer rather than the visible viewport (users scroll) and debounces working→idle
across 3 confirmations over 700ms so a momentarily quiet agent does not flicker.
Reimplementing that badly is a guaranteed source of flapping cards.

The one supported exception, **M2 or later**: if Osade wants tool-level activity for Claude
Code, install an *additional* Claude Code hook that calls `pane.report_metadata` using
`<prefix>_PANE_ID` and `<prefix>_SOCKET_PATH` from the environment. That is the substrate's own documented
inbound API, not a parallel system. Token limits apply: ≤16 keys per patch, ≤32 stored, key
`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}$` (`backend/src/api/schema/common.rs:3-23`).

## 8. Agent catalog and launch

### 8.1 The catalog

Declarative table, `packages/daemon/src/domain/agent-catalog.ts`, modeled on Kanban's:

```ts
interface AgentCatalogEntry {
  id: AgentId;                    // 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini' | 'opencode' | 'droid' | 'kiro' | ...
  binary: string;
  baseArgs: string[];
  autonomousArgs: string[];
  planArgs: string[];
  resumeArgs: string[];
  systemPromptFlag: SystemPromptStyle;   // how conventions get injected (§15.4)
  capabilities: AgentCapability[];
  env: Record<string, string>;
}
```

Known shapes to seed from (verify each against the installed binary before shipping it as
supported — flags change):

| id | binary | autonomous | plan | resume | system prompt |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | `claude` | `--permission-mode auto` | `--permission-mode plan` | `--continue` | `--append-system-prompt` |
| `codex` | `codex` | `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` | deferred `/plan` input | `resume --last` | `-c developer_instructions=` |
| `droid` | `droid` | `--auto high` | `autonomyMode: spec` | `--resume` | `--append-system-prompt` |
| `kiro` | `kiro-cli chat` | `--trust-all-tools` | — | `--resume` | agent config file |
| `gemini` | `gemini` | `--yolo` | — | — | varies |
| `opencode` | `opencode` | — | — | — | plugin file |

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #4 and #8.*

**`binary` is advisory.** the substrate picks the executable, not Osade:
`interactive_agent_executable` maps a `kind` to a fixed name
(`backend/src/detect/mod.rs:149-181`) — `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `kiro-cli`, `agy`,
`cursor-agent(.cmd)`, and so on. Keep the field for **probing** and for a useful "agent not
installed" error; never pass it to the substrate. The `kind` string is what the substrate accepts, and the
pinned set is:

```
pi codex claude gemini cursor devin agy cline omp mastracode opencode copilot
kimi kiro droid amp grok hermes kilo qodercli qwen maki
```

(§8.1's table wrote `kiro` as `kiro-cli chat`. The kind is `kiro`, the executable the substrate runs
is `kiro-cli`, and `chat` is an argument.)

**INVARIANT — capabilities, not identity checks.** Branch on
`entry.capabilities.includes('plan-mode')`, never on `agentId === 'claude'`. AO's model:
harnesses opt into behavior they can prove they support, rather than being flattened to a
lowest common denominator. Capability list for v1:

```
'plan-mode' | 'resume' | 'system-prompt-injection' | 'hook-reporting'
| 'structured-review-output' | 'headless-run'
```

An agent without `hook-reporting` still works — it just relies on the substrate's screen-manifest
detection and gets a lower-confidence badge in the UI.

**`hook-reporting` is set for `pi`, `opencode`, `kimi`, `kilo`, `omp`, `mastracode` and
cleared for everything else — including `claude` and `codex`** (§7.1). This is exactly the
case the capability was designed for, and it is not a lower tier: the live test showed
screen-manifest detection carrying Claude Code's whole lifecycle correctly. What the two
leading agents lose is `tool_name` and `final_message`, not status.

**PATH matters.** Probe binaries with direct PATH checks and spawn directly. Never shell out to
`zsh -i` to find a binary: with heavy conda/nvm init that freezes the runtime when several
tasks start at once. This bit Kanban; do not rediscover it. Probing is now the *only* reason
Osade cares about the binary path — the substrate resolves it independently, so a probe that passes
while the substrate's spawn fails means the executable is not on the **server's** PATH.

### 8.2 Launch sequence

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #8 and #11. The old step 7 — "build argv … spawn in the
agent lane" — is not possible: no pane-creating method accepts a command.*

**How `agent.start` actually works.** It does not spawn a process. It resolves `kind` to a
fixed executable, appends `args` (rejecting control characters), shell-quotes the line, and
**types it into an existing idle shell pane**, then waits for its detector to confirm the
agent is interactive (`backend/src/app/agents.rs:145-225`). Three consequences shape the
sequence below: the lane must exist and be at a shell prompt first; **environment cannot be
set at `agent.start`** and must be set when the workspace or tab is created; and a pane hosts
at most one agent.

`packages/daemon/src/domain/launch-task.ts`:

1. Resolve agent: `task.agent_id ?? repo.default_agent ?? config.selected_agent`. On resume,
   the previously used agent wins so a restored task comes back on the same runtime.
2. `git -C <repo> worktree prune`, then ensure worktree (§9), then mirror gitignored-but-needed
   paths into it — **all three before anything is spawned**.
3. `worktree.create` gives the worktree **and** its workspace in one call; record
   `substrate_workspace_id`. The root pane is the `shell` lane.
4. Create the `agent` lane with `tab.create { workspace_id, label: "agent", focus: false,
   env: { OSADE_TASK_ID, … } }`. **This is the only opportunity to set environment** — see
   above. `verify` is created on first verification run, with the same env.
5. Render the launch context (§13.5) to `<worktree>/.osade/CONTEXT.md`.
6. Open the pane-status subscription for the new pane (§7.2) **before** starting the agent, so
   the launch transition is not missed.
7. `agent.start { name, kind, pane_id, args, timeout_ms }`, where `args` carries everything
   from the catalog entry — mode args and system-prompt injection alike.
8. Capture a `turn_checkpoint` with trigger `launch`. Best-effort — **a checkpoint capture
   failure never fails a launch.**

*Corrected 2026-09-05 per PRD-DELTA #13a, found while implementing M0.*

**INVARIANT — `agent.start` is submission, not readiness.** It can return success immediately
with `launch_pending: true` and `agent_status: unknown`, before the agent has rendered
anything; or it can return `agent_not_ready` because the substrate's detector saw the trust prompt.
Neither outcome tells you the agent is usable. Step 7 is therefore followed by a bounded wait
on `agent.get` for `interactive_ready && !launch_pending`, answering the trust prompt if it
appears during that wait — one loop, one deadline, because the two interleave. Launch does not
report success until that wait passes; otherwise the very next `agent.prompt` fails.

**Windows: `agent.start` cannot carry args.** the substrate submits args through PowerShell's
`Start-Process -FilePath`, which cannot execute an extensionless npm shim — and most agent
CLIs on Windows are npm shims. The pane shows `%1 is not a valid Win32 application`, no agent
appears, and the call still reports success. So on Windows the agent starts **bare** and the
launch context is delivered through `<worktree>/.osade/CONTEXT.md` per §13.5. Mode args are
lost; report that rather than hiding it.

**Error codes from step 7 need distinct handling; only the first is routine**
(`backend/src/app/agents.rs:228-260`):

| Code | Meaning | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_not_ready` | started, but blocked or not interactive within `timeout_ms` | usually the trust prompt — §8.3, then re-wait |
| `agent_pane_busy` | pane already hosts an agent, or is not at a shell prompt | fresh pane, or `pane.close` first |
| `unsupported_agent_kind` | `kind` not in the pinned set | catalog bug; fail the launch |
| `invalid_agent_argument` | control char in an arg, or unquotable for the shell | catalog or context bug; fail the launch |
| `agent_pane_not_found` / `agent_pane_unavailable` | bad pane id, dead terminal | reconcile against `session.snapshot` (§5.4.1) |
| `invalid_agent_name` / `duplicate_agent_name` | name rules | derive the name from `task.id` |

### 8.2.1 Relaunch after a substrate restart

the substrate restores panes but not agent processes (§6). On reconnect, for every task whose
workspace exists and whose pane has no bound agent:

1. Reconcile from `session.snapshot` first — do not act on an event alone.
2. Re-run `agent.start` in the restored pane. It is back at a shell prompt, so
   `agent_pane_busy` will not fire.
3. Use the catalog's `resumeArgs` plus the `agent_session_id` recorded in `agent_fact`, when
   the agent has the `resume` capability. Without it, relaunch cold with the task intent.
4. Never set `terminated`. The task is `queued`, not `stopped`.

### 8.3 First-run trust prompts

Claude and Codex show a "do you trust this folder?" prompt, and Osade's cwd is a freshly created
worktree every single time, so this fires constantly.

*Confirmed 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #13.* This fired on the very first launch into a fresh
worktree: `agent.start` returned `agent_not_ready` and the substrate's detector classified the pane
`blocked` — correctly, with no Osade screen-scraping. The verified recipe, entirely within
the substrate's API:

*Corrected 2026-09-05 per PRD-DELTA #13a.2b — the original recipe here was unsafe.*

**INVARIANT — read the selection; never navigate blind.** Keystrokes sent while the TUI is
still painting are dropped silently, and the prompt defaults to `❯ No, exit`. A dropped `Down`
therefore puts `Enter` on *decline*: Claude exits, and the launch fails ninety seconds later
looking like a timeout. Osade will have declined the folder on the user's behalf and reported
something else.

```
loop (bounded, ~5 attempts):
  selection = read the selector out of pane.read { source: "visible" }
  null      → no live prompt (options with no ❯ are stale scrollback); stop
  'trust'   → pane.send_keys { keys: ["Enter"] }; done
  'decline' → pane.send_keys { keys: ["Down"] }, wait, re-read
```

Then wait for `agent.get` to report `interactive_ready` (§8.2). If the selection never reaches
the trust option, **stop and leave it for a human** rather than pressing Enter hopefully.

**Match the specific prompt; never auto-confirm a `blocked` state generically.** Any other
`blocked` is §6 row 4 — the user is being asked something, and answering it for them is the
one thing this product must not do.

If the substrate's manifest can't express the match, add a rule to
`backend/distribution/agent-detection/*.toml` upstream rather than adding output scanning to
Osade.

---

## 9. Worktrees

the substrate already makes git worktrees first-class workspace containers, with creation, opening and
removal guarded against active agent panes (`src/worktree.rs`, `src/workspace/git/`). **Osade
calls the substrate for worktree lifecycle. It does not shell out to `git worktree` itself.**

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #10. Three of these six rules are not the substrate's and must be
implemented by Osade; the annotations say which.*

What Osade owns is the *policy*, and these rules are hard-won — they come from Kanban destroying
user work by getting them wrong:

1. **An existing worktree is authoritative.** Never compare worktree HEAD against a moved base
   branch and recreate. That destroys task progress. Only create *missing* worktrees.
   — **the substrate's.** `worktree.open` on an existing path returns `already_open` and never
   recreates.
2. Creation is serialized by a repo-level lock, with a double-check inside the lock.
   — **Osade's.** the substrate has no cross-call lock; two concurrent `worktree.create` calls on one
   repo race.
3. Run `git worktree prune` before `add`: an interrupted removal leaves a registration behind
   and `add` then fails with "missing but already registered."
   — **Osade's.** the substrate never prunes (`backend/src/worktree.rs:238-320`). This failure *will*
   happen. §1's carve-out exists for this line.
4. The worktree is created on the resolved base commit (`task.base_sha`), then the branch is
   created there. A pinned base means a moving `main` cannot silently change what an agent is
   building against.
   — **the substrate's, by outcome.** It runs `git worktree add -b <branch> <path> <base>` for a new
   branch and `git worktree add <path> <branch>` for an existing one. This section previously
   specified `--detach`-then-branch; that mechanism is not what the substrate does and Osade cannot
   control it. Verified: `base: 089a586` produced a worktree on the new branch at exactly that
   commit, which is what the rule is for.
5. **Mirror gitignored-but-needed paths** into the worktree: `.env`, `.env.local`, local tool
   configs, and anything in `repo.mirror_paths`. Symlink where possible, copy where the tool
   resolves symlinks. Without this, half of real repos won't even boot in a worktree.
   — **Osade's.** No the substrate concept. Must run after `worktree.create` returns and **before**
   `agent.start` (§8.2 step 2).
6. Removal requires: no live pane in the task's the substrate workspace, no uncommitted changes, or an
   explicit force with a typed confirmation.
   — **the substrate's.** `worktree.remove` refuses a dirty checkout without `force`
   (`backend/src/worktree.rs:214`) and recovers from leftover checkouts (`:343`).
   — *Corrected 2026-09-05 per PRD-DELTA #13a.3.* **The teardown order is the reverse of the
   obvious one.** `worktree.remove` is addressed by workspace id, and the substrate closes a workspace
   when its last pane closes — so closing every pane first leaves nothing to address
   (`workspace_not_found`), while leaving a live shell inside the checkout makes the directory
   undeletable on Windows (`Permission denied`, even with `force`). Close every pane **but
   one**, move that survivor out of the checkout (`cd ~` works in both POSIX shells and
   PowerShell), then remove. `force` overrides uncommitted changes, never live panes.

Path layout: `~/.osade/worktrees/<repo_slug>/<task_id>/`.

### 9.1 Turn checkpoints and undo

Capture a git ref snapshot on each launch and each `to_review`/`to_in_progress` transition,
stored as `turn_checkpoint` rows. `refs/osade/turns/<task_id>/<n>`.

"Undo this turn" resets the worktree to the previous checkpoint. It must:
- refuse while a pane is live in the task (stop the agent first),
- stash-and-label rather than discard uncommitted work,
- be its own gate (`gate.undo_turn`) when the diff is larger than N files.

All checkpoint capture is best-effort and never blocks the agent.

---

## 10. Verification

The point of verification is to make an agent's claim checkable **before** it costs a maintainer
anything. This is the largest single lever on the design goal in §0.1.

### 10.1 Deriving the plan

`packages/daemon/src/domain/verify-plan.ts` builds a `VerifyPlan` per repo from evidence, not
guesses:

- CI config: `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `justfile`, `Makefile`, `taskfile.yml`
- Package manifests: `package.json` scripts, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`
- Repo docs: `CONTRIBUTING.md` sections mentioning tests/lint

```ts
interface VerifyStep {
  name: string; cmd: string; cwd: string;
  timeoutSec: number; required: boolean;
  source: 'ci' | 'manifest' | 'doc' | 'user';   // provenance, shown in UI
}
```

The plan is **shown to the user and editable** before first use, stored per repo. Never run an
inferred command silently the first time.

Corrected 2026-09-06 per PRD-DELTA #18: CI comes first, and it is actually parsed. §13.2 rates CI
"mechanically enforced, so it is definitionally true", so a command the project's own
pull-request workflow runs beats one inferred from a manifest; manifest steps then fill in what
CI does not cover, and the same check is never added twice under two spellings. Two limits are
deliberate. **Only pull-request-triggered workflows count** — a nightly job is not what a
contribution is judged against. **Unresolvable steps are skipped and reported, never guessed** —
a `run:` containing a matrix expression has no meaning outside the runner, and inventing one
produces a step that fails for reasons the agent cannot fix; `VerifyPlan.skippedCiSteps` carries
them so the review can see the plan is partial. A CI-sourced plan is still `needsReview`: a
command that passes on GitHub's runner can fail on a laptop.

### 10.2 Running

Runs execute in the task worktree, in the `verify` lane (a substrate tab), so the user can watch and
interrupt. One `verify_run` row per step. stdout/stderr to `~/.osade/runs/<run_id>/`, capped at
2 MiB with head+tail retention.

On failure: the tail of the log plus the failing command is sent back into the agent lane as a
prompt. That closed loop — *agent acts, environment answers, agent adapts* — is the thing the
whole product is organized around, and it should be the demo.

Verification is required before `gate.pr_open` can be approved. That is a policy default, and
it is overridable per repo, but the override is recorded.

---

## 11. GitHub integration

`packages/daemon/src/scm/`. Octokit. **This is the only directory permitted to import an SCM
SDK** (lint-enforced).

### 11.1 Reads — polling, not webhooks

v1 is local-first with no public ingress, so there is no webhook endpoint. Poll:

| Data | Interval | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR state, checks, reviews for tasks with an open PR | 30s | matches AO's scm observer cadence |
| Issue list for watched repos | 5 min | |
| Rate limit headers | every response | back off at <20% remaining |

Conditional requests with ETags. A failed poll writes `fetch_failed_at` and changes nothing
else — **INVARIANT: a failed fetch is a fact, not a state change.**

**Reviews are read per author** (added 2026-09-10, after finding the opposite in the
implementation). GitHub's review list is a chronological log, not a verdict, and reducing it
requires its actual semantics: `APPROVED` and `CHANGES_REQUESTED` replace *that author's*
standing verdict, `COMMENTED` carries no verdict and leaves a standing one alone, `DISMISSED`
clears it. A single running verdict over the whole list gets this wrong in a way that matters:
one reviewer's approval cancels a different reviewer's outstanding request, and the task leaves
the needs-you set with a maintainer still waiting. One outstanding request outranks any number
of approvals.

The same grouping decides what reaches the agent. A reviewer who asked and then approved has
been satisfied, so replaying their words spends the agent's turn re-fixing something already
accepted — only still-standing requests are delivered.

### 11.2 Writes — all gated

Every write is a `gate_request` first. The payload is hashed at request time and re-hashed at
execution time; a mismatch aborts. This prevents a "approve this comment" decision from being
executed against different text.

Gated write actions: `pr_open`, `pr_update`, `pr_comment`, `issue_comment`, `review_submit`,
`push`, `force_push`, `branch_delete`.

### 11.3 Fork awareness

Most OSS contribution goes through a fork. `repo.fork_of` and `repo.upstream_remote` exist for
this. On PR open: push to the fork's remote, open the PR against `upstream:default_branch`.
If the user has no fork, offer to create one behind a gate. Never push to an upstream you do
not own — check permissions before offering the action, not after.

---

## 12. Issue intake and triage

Import an issue → create a task. But the higher-value path, and the one that earns maintainer
trust, is triage that produces **no PR at all**:

- reproduce the reported bug in a clean worktree and report whether it reproduces
- bisect a regression to a commit
- write a failing test that demonstrates the bug
- check whether the issue duplicates an existing one
- verify that a *human's* PR does what its description claims

These are `origin_kind='triage'` tasks. They terminate in an artifact (a reproduction log, a
bisect result, a failing test patch) rather than a PR. Ship this in M2 alongside the PR path,
because it is the wedge: a maintainer will accept a bot that saves them 40 minutes of triage
long before they accept a bot that adds a PR to their queue.

---

## 13. Repository skills — the conventions miner

This is Osade's actual novelty. Everything else is assembly.

### 13.1 The thesis

What gets a PR merged is not code correctness, it is conformance to a project's tacit rules.
Those rules exist in the record — in review comments, in what got rejected, in the difference
between what was submitted and what was merged. Nobody treats that record as a mineable,
citable artifact.

**INVARIANT: a rule without evidence is not a rule.** Every `convention` row must have at least
one `convention_evidence` row pointing at a real URL. Reject unciteable rules at write time.
This is what makes the output auditable rather than another pile of model-generated guidance.

### 13.2 Inputs, weighted by signal

| Source | Weight | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Closed-unmerged PRs** | highest | Rejection is the strongest signal and everyone ignores it |
| **`changes_requested` review threads** | highest | Explicit statements of what was wrong |
| Diff between PR head and merge commit | high | What maintainers silently fixed |
| Merged PR review comments | medium | Style nudges, conventions in passing |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, issue/PR templates | medium | Stated rules — often stale, so mark provenance |
| CI config | high | Mechanically enforced, so it is definitionally true |

Default sample: last 200 merged PRs, last 100 closed-unmerged, capped by rate limit budget.

### 13.3 Categories

```
review_process    — when to open a draft, when an RFC/issue is required first
scope_limits      — "one concern per PR", "no drive-by refactors"
commit_style      — conventional commits, sign-off, message format
test_requirements — what must have a test, where tests live
file_ownership    — areas that need a specific reviewer or are effectively frozen
communication     — comment on the issue before implementing, how to ask
ci_gates          — what must be green
```

### 13.4 The mining pipeline

Three bounded passes. Each is a separate model call with a narrow job — do not build one
mega-prompt.

1. **Extract.** Per PR/thread, emit candidate observations with quotes and URLs. No
   generalization at this stage.
2. **Cluster.** Group observations into candidate rules. A rule needs ≥3 supporting
   observations from ≥2 distinct PRs, or ≥1 observation from a CI config or CODEOWNERS.
3. **Verify.** Test each candidate against a held-out sample of merged PRs. If the rule
   predicts what happened, `confidence` goes up; if merged PRs routinely violate it, mark
   `rejected`. Store the confidence.

**The model proposes; the code decides.** Corrected 2026-09-06: every threshold above is
enforced *between* the passes rather than asked for in a prompt — a prompt that says "a rule
needs three observations" is a suggestion, a filter that counts them is a guarantee. Three
things follow, and they are the difference between this pipeline and a wrapper around a
question:

- **Only cited URLs survive.** An observation whose URL was not in that pass's input is dropped
  before it can become evidence. A fabricated permalink would satisfy §13.1's letter and destroy
  its purpose.
- **The held-out sample is held out of *extraction*, not merely of verification.** Testing a
  rule against the very comments that produced it measures nothing. Rejected PRs are never held
  out: §13.2 rates them the strongest signal there is and there are far fewer of them.
- **A contradicted rule is written as `rejected`, not dropped.** Knowing a rule was considered
  and disproved is worth more than mining it again next week.

Rules land as `lifecycle='candidate'` (PRD-DELTA #16). Promotion to `active` requires either
confidence ≥ 0.8 or one-click human confirmation in the UI. Show the evidence next to the
toggle.

Confidence combines §13.2's weights with §13.4's verification: half the strongest source's
weight, half how broadly it was observed, multiplied by how the held-out sample behaved. The
floor matters — a rule the sample could not confirm lands below the 0.8 bar and therefore waits
for a human. A rule nobody checked should not start steering agents on its own. CI is the
exception: a workflow that runs a job is not a claim about the project, it *is* the project.

**Re-mine incrementally.** Weekly, or on demand, mining only PRs newer than the last completed
run's high-water mark. Only *completed* runs advance it, or a crash halfway would skip the PRs
it never reached, forever. A re-mine that sees a rule again **re-confirms** it — matching on
content-word overlap within a category — rather than depositing a paraphrase beside it, because
duplicates would fill the §13.5 budget and `last_confirmed_at` would never advance on the
original. Conventions decay: an `active` rule not re-confirmed in 180 days drops to `candidate`.
Decay runs *before* a mining run, not after, so a stale rule is not quietly renewed by a run
that never saw fresh evidence for it.

**Where the model comes from** (added 2026-09-06 per PRD-DELTA #17). The miner is the only place
the daemon itself needs inference; every other model in Osade is an agent the substrate owns. It calls
the Anthropic Messages API through a one-method `ModelPort`, with the key read from
`OSADE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` at the use site and held in memory only — the same discipline §2.1
gives the GitHub token. **Mining is optional by construction:** a daemon with no key serves
everything else normally and reports why mining is unavailable rather than failing when someone
presses the button. Mining is also always explicit — it spends GitHub quota and model tokens, so
nothing starts it on its own and no task launch ever waits on it.

**A run is a background job, not a request** (added 2026-09-10). A first mine of a large
repository is minutes of model calls, which is the wrong shape for request-response: a single
long mutation holds a connection open with nothing to show, and a client that gives up learns
nothing about a run that is still spending money. Starting a mine returns a run id immediately
and the run reports itself into `mine_run` — phase and a count — where a poll can read it and a
second window watching the same daemon sees the same thing. Three consequences:

- **The row exists before the work does.** Fetching the corpus is itself minutes of GitHub calls,
  so the run is recorded as `fetching` before the first request goes out.
- **A background failure has to be durable.** There is no caller to throw at, so a failed run is
  written to its row, and a run that failed never advances the high-water mark.
- **A run whose daemon died is marked `interrupted` at the next startup.** The in-memory lock
  cannot survive a restart, so without this an unfinished row would look like a run in progress
  forever and the button would never re-enable. The partial work is kept — conventions written
  before the crash are still cited and still valid.

The weekly half of "re-mine weekly, or on demand" is **reported, never performed**: a timer that
mined every Monday would spend the user's quota and tokens while they were not looking, which is
exactly what "mining is always explicit" forbids. A repo that has gone a week is flagged as due
and the UI offers it. Never having been mined is not overdue.

### 13.5 Injection

Render active conventions into `<worktree>/.osade/CONTEXT.md` at launch:

```markdown
# Contributing to <repo>

## Rules this project enforces
- <rule_text>
  <sub>evidence: PR #1234 (rejected), PR #1290 (changes requested)</sub>
...

## Verification you must pass before this is reviewable
- <verify steps>

## What you are working on
- <task.intent>
- base: <base_sha> on <base_ref>
```

Injected per the agent's `systemPromptFlag`. For agents without system-prompt injection, the
file is written and referenced in the opening prompt.

**Keep it short.** Cap at 40 active rules and ~2000 tokens. A 200-rule context file is
worse than none — it dilutes attention and every rule competes with the actual task. If more
than 40 rules are active, rank by confidence × recency and surface the overflow in the UI
rather than the prompt.

Corrected 2026-09-06: the cap is enforced in the renderer, not requested of the caller. Rules are
ranked by confidence × recency (recency halving every 90 days), truncated to whatever fits the
token budget after the non-negotiable sections — the task, the base, the verification, and the
gate boundaries — and what did not fit is *returned to the caller* rather than dropped in
silence. Verification is named here only when the plan has been **confirmed**: §10.1 says an
inferred command is never run silently, and telling an agent to satisfy commands that will not
run is the same mistake wearing a different hat.

### 13.6 The measurable claim

This feature exists to move one number: **review rounds to merge.** Instrument it from day one.
`scm_fact` already carries enough to compute it. The M3 acceptance criterion is a real
comparison on real tasks, not a vibe.

Corrected 2026-09-06: `scm_fact` carries the PR, but not which side of the comparison a task
fell on — that is only knowable at launch, because by the time a PR merges the repo's
conventions have moved on. So `task_injection` records how many rules each launch actually
injected, written when the context file is. Rounds are then counted from GitHub's own review
record rather than from anything Osade stored, and a PR whose reviews cannot be read is reported
as unreadable rather than folded into either arm: no review and no data are not the same
observation. The comparison is built to be able to return bad news — below §21's N ≥ 10 per arm
it refuses a verdict and says so.

## 14. Approval gates

The mechanism behind "safe autonomous contribution." Without this the product is a liability.

### 14.1 The gate list

| Gate | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gate.commit` | auto | local only, reversible via checkpoint |
| `gate.push` | **human** | first write that leaves the machine |
| `gate.pr_open` | **human** | requires passing verification |
| `gate.pr_comment` | **human** | public speech |
| `gate.issue_comment` | **human** | public speech |
| `gate.review_submit` | **human** | public speech about someone else's work |
| `gate.force_push` | **human** | always, no policy override |
| `gate.branch_delete` | **human** | |
| `gate.fork_create` | **human** | creates a public repository under the user's account. *Added 2026-09-06 for §11.3's "offer to create one behind a gate"; not policy-overridable, because forking on someone's behalf is a visible public act.* |
| `gate.dep_add` | **human** | supply chain |
| `gate.file_write_outside_worktree` | **human** | should never happen; if it fires, investigate |
| `gate.undo_turn` | conditional | human if diff > 20 files |
| `gate.network_egress` | auto, logged | v1 logs only; enforcement is M5 |

**INVARIANT: anything that writes to a public GitHub surface defaults to human approval.**
A policy may downgrade a gate, and that downgrade is itself recorded in `decided_by` as
`policy:<name>` so the audit trail never loses who decided.

### 14.2 UX

Gate requests are the top of the ledger, above everything else. A gate card shows: the exact
action, a rendered diff or the exact comment text, which task it came from, the verification
state, and Approve / Deny / Edit-and-approve. Editing rewrites the payload and re-hashes.

Batch approval is allowed for `gate.commit` only. Never batch a public write.

Gates expire after 24h into `decision='expired'`. An expired gate is not a denial and can be
re-requested.

---

## 15. Layered memory

Five scopes, per the product brief: `personal`, `org`, `repo`, `task`, `agent`.

### 15.1 The write gate — INVARIANT

**Only entries with `verified_by != null` may be written above `task` scope.**

Unverified discoveries stay task-local and die with the task. A claim gets promoted to repo or
org scope only when a `verify_run` confirmed it empirically. Without this rule, one agent's
wrong guess becomes every future agent's ground truth, and the shared memory becomes a
poisoning vector rather than an asset. This is the single most likely way for the "shared agent
memory" feature to make the product actively worse.

### 15.2 Cross-repo transfer — INVARIANT

**Conventions never transfer across repos.** What is true for repo A is false for repo B, and
bleeding them is a bug, not a feature.

What *does* transfer is ecosystem-level operational knowledge, and only when tagged:

```
transferable:     kind='howto' AND ecosystem_tag IS NOT NULL
                  e.g. "under pnpm workspaces, run tests with --filter to avoid the full graph"
not transferable: kind='fact' scoped to a repo; anything from the convention table
```

Retrieval query: cosine over `memory_vec`, filtered to
`(scope='task' AND scope_id=<task>) OR (scope='repo' AND scope_id=<repo>) OR (scope='org' AND
scope_id=<org>) OR scope='personal' OR (ecosystem_tag IN <repo ecosystems>)`, with recency
decay and a hard cap of 12 entries injected.

### 15.3 Provenance and expiry

Every entry keeps `source_task_id`, `source_agent`, and `created_at`. Entries about tooling get
a 90-day `expires_at` by default. Superseding writes set `superseded_by` rather than deleting,
so the audit trail survives.

The UI must let the user read and delete any memory entry, filtered by scope. A shared memory
you cannot inspect is a shared memory you cannot trust.

## 16. The reviewer gateway

Adapted from AO's `reviewgateway` / ADR 0002, which is a genuine capability-confinement design
rather than "run an agent with a review prompt."

When a reviewer agent runs, it gets:

- **A neutral filesystem.** Osade-owned `HOME`, config, cache, and temp roots under
  `~/.osade/review/<review_id>/`. Not the user's dotfiles.
- **No credentials.** No GitHub token, no push remote, no SSH agent forwarding.
- **An immutable, hash-verified manifest** listing exactly what it may review:

```json
{
  "review_id": "...",
  "pr_url": "https://github.com/o/r/pull/1234",
  "head_sha": "...",
  "base_sha": "...",
  "changed_files": ["src/a.ts", "src/b.ts"],
  "manifest_sha256": "..."
}
```

- **The source checkout is deliberately absent from its working directory.** It reviews a
  detached checkout of `head_sha` plus the diff, nothing else.
- **Output is a structured artifact, never a GitHub write.** Posting it is `gate.review_submit`.

Trigger policy, following AO's autoreview: on an idle threshold after a task reaches
`awaiting_review`, with bounded retries per PR head sha, so a churning PR does not spawn
unbounded reviews.

---

## 17. Multi-agent coordination — self-hosting, not a new protocol

**DECISION: agents coordinate by driving the `osade` CLI, exactly as a human would. We do not
build an agent-to-agent protocol.**

This is AO's best structural idea and it fits the substrate perfectly, since the substrate already has a full
one-shot CLI (`the substrate pane/agent/tab/...`) that talks to the same JSON API.

Mechanism:

1. `packages/cli` provides `osade` verbs: `task list`, `task create`, `task show`,
   `task send`, `verify run`, `gate request`, `memory write`, `conventions show`,
   `review request`.
   
   Added 2026-09-11: **`osade .`** — open the window on the repository you are standing in, the
   shape people already know from `code .`. It registers the repo and scopes the window to it,
   and `osade <path>` does the same for somewhere else. The path is resolved to the repository
   *root* by the daemon, because `osade .` is typed from wherever you happen to be, usually a
   subdirectory; asking git is the only thing that gets worktrees and submodules right. A bare
   word is only read as a path when a directory of that name exists **and** it is not a verb, so
   `osade task` can never become "open ./task". A second `osade .` elsewhere re-scopes the window
   you already have rather than opening a second one.
2. The daemon embeds a **skill asset** describing those verbs and installs it to
   `~/.osade/skills/using-osade/` at boot, so any agent in any worktree has a stable absolute
   path to the catalog. Mirrors the substrate's own `skillassets` approach.
3. An **orchestrator agent** gets a repo-scoped persistent session with no worktree of its own,
   and delegates by calling the same commands a user would.
4. Every CLI call from an agent carries `OSADE_TASK_ID` from its environment, so writes are
   attributed and scoped automatically.

Consequences worth stating: the orchestrator has no privileged path. It cannot bypass a gate,
because gates live in the daemon, not in the caller. Anything an orchestrator can do, a human
can do from a terminal, and vice versa. That symmetry is the point.

**Home lane.** Kanban's synthetic-id trick is worth stealing: a sidebar agent with no task and
no worktree, running at the repo root, reusing the entire session stack. Use a synthetic id
`__orchestrator__:<repo_id>`, define it in exactly one place, and lint against the raw literal
appearing anywhere else.

```

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #3.* Everything marked M1 is out of M0 scope: §4.4 defers
the embedded terminal, so M0 ships no utility process, no `MessageChannelMain`, and no cell
renderer. `supervisor/substrate.ts`'s "version guard" is now the boot drift check of §4.1.1 — it
compares protocol and method set, never the version string.

**INVARIANT — the renderer is never the source of truth.** It renders streamed state. It never
computes status (that is §6, in the daemon), never caches a session, never decides a gate. On
reconnect it discards local state and takes the snapshot.

**Startup order**, and it matters.
*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #12 and #1.*

1. `app.setPath('userData', ...)` — before anything else touches disk
2. Run the boot drift check (§4.1.1) against the substrate binary about to be used. Fatal on
   protocol or missing-method mismatch, **before** anything is spawned.
3. Adopt-or-spawn the substrate server on the `osade` named session, then wait for `ping`.
   - `<prefix>_SESSION=osade` on the server process and on every subsequent call. Verified to run
     concurrently with a user's own `default` session — separate sockets, separate
     `session.json`, no interference (`backend/src/session.rs:10-11`, `:157-185`).
   - **Spawn detached, copying the substrate's own recipe** (`backend/src/server/autodetect.rs:188-233`):
     `osade-runtime server` with stdin/stdout/stderr null and `DETACHED_PROCESS` on Windows /
     `setsid` on Unix. Without this the server dies with its parent, and "agents survive the
     app quitting" quietly stops being true. (`ping`'s
     `capabilities.detached_server_daemon` reports whether *this* server was started that
     way — it is a status report, not a platform limit.)
   - **`env_remove('<prefix>_STARTUP_CWD')`.** If it is set and the session has no workspaces,
     the substrate creates a workspace at that cwd on boot
     (`backend/src/server/headless/bootstrap.rs:89-117`) and Osade inherits a stray workspace
     it did not create.
4. Spawn the daemon; wait for its ready handshake (never a fixed sleep)
5. Create the window; renderer connects to the daemon. **No surface port in M0** (§4.4).

*Corrected 2026-09-11, after running the app for the first time.* Step 4 says "spawn the
daemon" and hides three decisions, each of which failed as the same unhelpful symptom — "the
daemon did not become healthy within 30s", a timeout standing in for a start that never
happened:

- **The daemon runs on Node, not on Electron's Node.** `process.execPath` under Electron is
  `electron.exe`, whose Node carries its own native ABI (`NODE_MODULE_VERSION` 130 for Electron
  33 against 127 for Node 22). `better-sqlite3` is compiled once, for Node, and has to be — the
  daemon also runs under the CLI and the test suite. §2 already treats the daemon as an
  independent process that outlives the window; the runtime has to match that. `OSADE_NODE_BIN`
  names it; `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` is the fallback when no Node is found, and it is a fallback
  rather than the plan because native modules will still be wrong.
- **A source checkout has no JavaScript to spawn.** The daemon entry is TypeScript and Node
  answers `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`. A packaged build spawns built JS directly; a checkout
  goes through the same dev runner the docs and tests already use.
- **`OSADE_HOME` is resolved before use.** Electron's `setPath` rejects a relative path with a
  bare "Path must be absolute", thrown before any of the app's own logging exists.

**The window is checked, not assumed.** `pnpm --filter @osade/desktop smoke` boots the real
sequence against a live daemon, waits for the renderer to load, and writes a screenshot —
failing on any renderer console error, and on an empty capture, which is what an unpainted
window silently produces. It is the only automated check that sees the renderer at all.

**Shutdown:** quitting the window detaches. It does **not** stop the substrate and does **not** stop the
daemon. Agents keep running. Add an explicit "Stop everything" menu item and a tray state so
this is discoverable rather than surprising.

**Vendoring the substrate:** ship a prebuilt substrate binary per platform in `vendor/runtime/<target>/`.
Do not build it at install time — the substrate requires Zig 0.15.2 as a hard build dependency for
`libghostty-vt`, which is not an acceptable user prerequisite. Pin the version and verify a
checksum at boot.

### 18.2 Surface transport — DEFERRED PAST M0

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #3. §4.4 reverses the embedded-terminal decision; this
section is the M1 design, kept because it is still correct for when the gate opens.*

M0 ships no `surface/` utility process and no `MessageChannelMain`. The `apps/desktop/src/`
tree in §18.1 drops `surface/` and the renderer's `surface/` directory until then.

When it comes back:

```
substrate client socket  ([u32LE len][bincode] frames — §4.3)
   └─ utilityProcess: EndpointControl handshake (advertise gen 1), negotiate
      shell.snapshot.v1 + shell.surface.v1 + shell.input.semantic.v1,
      decode ServerMessage frames
        └─ port.postMessage(frame)  ── MessageChannelMain ──► renderer
             └─ cell buffer + damage rects → canvas draw on rAF
```

Three things §18.2 originally assumed that are false, and which the M1 design must carry:

- The frames are **bincode**, not JSON (§4.3). The utility process owns a decoder pinned to
  the vendored substrate, with a boot assertion that a known frame decodes.
- A connection delivers **one composited tab**, not one pane (§4.4). So there is one
  connection per visible *surface*, LRU-capped at 3, each pinned to its task's workspace and
  tab via the connection-local projection (`backend/src/server/clients.rs:174-175`).
- Because a connection is per-tab, the "several viewers of one PTY" case that motivated the
  backpressure design mostly disappears — a ledger preview and a detail view of the same task
  are the same tab and should share one connection rather than open two.

Input goes the other way as `shell.input.semantic.v1`. Handle: kitty keyboard protocol,
bracketed paste, dead-key composition. the substrate handles these explicitly on its side; the client
must not mangle them on the way in.

Backpressure, where viewers do diverge: track per-viewer acknowledged bytes; pause the shared
stream when the slowest viewer exceeds a high-water mark and resume only when the *last* slow
viewer drains below the low-water mark. Kanban's numbers are a reasonable starting point:
16 KiB high, 4 KiB low, 4ms batch interval with a fast path for chunks under 256 B.

**Terminals are parked, not unmounted.** Keep surface canvases in a hidden root and move them,
so switching tasks never drops or re-subscribes a session. Kanban learned this; it is not
optional.

**And note §4.4's INVARIANT:** attaching any client marks panes seen, which flips `done` to
`idle`. That is safe only because `idle` is inert (§6.1). Do not change that when this lands.

---

## 19. Design direction

The brief has a real subject: this is a record of machine work on a public commons. The
vernacular is commits, patches, review threads, changelogs, `git status` porcelain. Design from
that, not from a generic dark SaaS board.

### 19.1 Concept: the ledger

An append-only public record, not a set of floating cards. Ruled rows in a fixed grid, a status
gutter on the left like porcelain output, evidence and provenance visible inline. **The kanban
column view exists but is not the default** — with eight parallel agents, a single vertical
ledger sorted needs-you-first answers the actual question ("who needs me?") better than
horizontal columns ever will.

### 19.2 Tokens

**Reversed 2026-09-11, by the owner.** This section read "light-first, which is itself a
differentiator in a category that is uniformly dark". The direction is now the opposite: Osade
should look like the terminal it sits beside, so it is dark, monospaced throughout, lowercase in
its chrome, and square-cornered. Recorded rather than quietly diverged from — the differentiation
argument was real, and it was traded away deliberately for belonging to the terminal.

**Color.** Dark ground. One blue accent, which means "this is what you are on" and nothing else;
everything not stateful is greyscale.

```
--paper       #0F1214    ground
--surface     #14181B    the sidebar, a shade above the ground as terminal chrome is
--field       #1B2025    inset surfaces, selected rows
--ink         #C9D1D9    body text
--ink-soft    #7D868E    secondary
--rule        #21262C    all borders, 1px, no shadows anywhere
--accent      #58A6FF    selection and focus only
```

State colors appear **only** as state, never as decoration or branding:

```
--st-needs  #D9903F    needs you        (approval, blocked, changes requested)
--st-live   #57A773    running          (implementing, verifying)
--st-fail   #CF6A67    failed           (verify, ci)
--st-rest   #6E7772    idle / merged / archived
```

Deliberately avoided: near-black with one acid accent; warm cream with terracotta; gradient
washes; a single shadow value under every card.

**Type.** IBM Plex Mono, everywhere. Plex was chosen because the whole product is a record of
machine work and it was drawn for that register; taking only the mono cut (2026-09-11, with the
colour reversal above) is what makes the screen read as a terminal rather than as an application
imitating one. Interface chrome is lowercase — headings, labels, buttons, status names — while
content keeps its own case: a task title, a mined rule and a reviewer's words are quoted, not
styled. Tabular numerals everywhere numbers align. Scale: 11 / 12.5 / 14 / 17 / 21.

Do not use all-caps labels. Do not put an eyebrow above every heading. Do not accent one word
in a headline.

**Structure.** Borders and rules carry information: a rule separates lanes of meaning, never
decorates. Zero shadows. One border radius (3px) on interactive controls only; surfaces are
square. Density is a feature — this is a tool for someone watching eight things at once.

### 19.3 Layout

```

- The gutter glyph set is fixed-width and fixed-position: `⚑ ● ✗ ○ ✓`. It is scannable
  peripherally, which is the whole job when eight agents are running.
- Ledger sort: needs-you set first, then live, then everything else. Never sort by creation
  time by default.
- The right pane is full-height and lane-tabbed. Terminal, verification output, diff, and
  review artifact are lanes of one surface, not separate screens.
- Conventions, memory, gates, and checkpoints live in a lower drawer on the task surface, so
  provenance is one click from the work rather than in a settings screen.

### 19.4 Motion and copy

One orchestrated moment: when a task enters the needs-you set, its row animates once into the
top group. Nothing else moves on its own. No fade-and-slide entrances, no hover transitions on
rows.

Copy: active voice, sentence case, and an action keeps its name through the whole flow — the
button that says "Open pull request" produces a row that says "Pull request opened." Empty
states name the next action. Failures state what broke and the command that broke it, in the
interface's voice, never apologizing.

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #14.* `vendor/runtime/` is keyed by
`<version>-p<protocol>`, not by version alone, because the version string is not a contract
(§4.1). The substrate's own repo furniture — its `AGENTS.md`, `.github/`, `.agents/skills/*` —
belongs under `backend/`, not at the Osade root, where it would be read as Osade's own
guidance. CLAUDE.md's rule that the substrate's `AGENTS.md` governs `backend/` only depends on it
actually living there.

### 20.1 Lint-enforced, not conventions

These are lint failures, not review comments. Wire them in ESLint `no-restricted-imports` plus
a small set of custom rules.

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| the substrate client importable only from `daemon/src/substrate/**` | one boundary to the substrate |
| Octokit importable only from `daemon/src/scm/**` | one boundary to GitHub |
| no `status` field written to any table | §6 is the invariant, enforce it mechanically |
| no WS emit outside `server/cdc-broadcaster.ts` | one event path (§5.4) |
| no raw `__orchestrator__` literal | one definition of the synthetic id (§17) |
| no `console.*` / `process.exit` in `daemon/src/**` except `cli.ts` | the daemon is a library, not a script |
| no `process.env` destructuring | env read at use sites, not snapshotted |
| no `any` | |
| renderer may not import from `daemon/src/**` | contract package only |

Keep `cli.ts` off the server import graph — lazily `await import(...)` the runtime inside
`startServer`. Short-lived subcommands that eagerly load the whole graph stay alive after
printing their result. This was a real bug in Kanban.

### 20.2 Testing

```
packages/daemon/test/unit/         pure reducers, derive-status, verify-plan. No I/O. Fast.
packages/daemon/test/integration/  real sqlite, fake substrate, recorded GitHub fixtures
apps/desktop/tests/                vitest + playwright on the renderer
test/e2e/                          real substrate binary, real git repo fixture, one full task
```

`derive-status` gets a property test: for any fact set, exactly one status, and no ordering of
fact writes produces a different result than the final state. That function is the spine.

The pre-commit gate is unit + integration. E2E runs in CI.

If CI hangs after tests appear to finish, suspect a live subprocess or a daemon a unit-style
suite booted, not a slow test body.

## 21. Milestones

Each milestone ends in a demo. Thin end-to-end slices, not layers.

### M0 — Spine (target: 1 week)

Prove the three-process architecture works before building any product on it.

*Corrected 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #15.*

- [ ] Vendor the substrate binary into `vendor/runtime/<version>-p<protocol>/`; generate the typed
      client **from the pinned `api-schema.json`, never from `backend/`**; implement the boot
      drift check (§4.1.1) — protocol and method set, never the version string
- [ ] Daemon: sqlite + migrations + change_log + CDC + ws snapshot/push
- [ ] the substrate event subscriber as an **N+1 connection manager** (§7.2), with the monotonic
      `state_change_seq` gate and `session.snapshot` reconciliation on every (re)connect
      (§5.4.1)
- [ ] `deriveStatus` implemented for rows 4, 10, 11, 13, 14 only
- [ ] Electron: userData redirect; supervisor with detached the substrate spawn and
      `<prefix>_STARTUP_CWD` cleared (§18.1); ledger, task detail, diff view, verification log
      tail. **No utility process, no canvas renderer** (§4.4)
- [ ] One task: create → prune + `worktree.create` + mirror → `tab.create` with env →
      subscribe → `agent.start` → resolve the trust prompt → `agent.prompt`

**Acceptance:** type a prompt and see the row move `queued → implementing → needs_input →
awaiting_review` driven entirely by the substrate's detection, with nothing polled and no status
column in the database. Watching the terminal is "Open in the substrate" (§4.4); the embedded surface
is M1, behind a gate.

This acceptance criterion is unchanged in substance — it never depended on rendering a cell.
The full path was already verified end-to-end against a live the substrate with no client attached
(`docs/SUBSTRATE-CONTRACT.md` §3.3); M0 is building the daemon and UI around a spine that is known
to work.

### M1 — Lifecycle, verification, gates

- [ ] Ledger view with the needs-you sort
- [ ] Full `deriveStatus` table
- [ ] Verify plan derivation, editable, `verify` lane, run rows, log capture
- [ ] Failure loop: verify fails → tail sent back to the agent lane
- [ ] Gate requests, payload hashing, approve/deny/edit UI
- [ ] Turn checkpoints + undo
- [ ] Multi-agent: 4 tasks in parallel on one repo, no cross-talk

**Acceptance:** a task runs `implementing → verifying → verify_failed → implementing →
awaiting_review` without a human touching it, and the commit is blocked until approved.

### M2 — GitHub and the contribution loop

- [ ] Issue import → task
- [ ] Triage task type (§12): reproduce, bisect, failing test — terminates without a PR
- [ ] scm polling, fork-aware push, gated PR open
- [ ] `review_changes_requested` loops back into the agent lane
- [ ] Rate-limit backoff, ETags

**Acceptance:** import a real issue from a repo you maintain; land one PR through the gate; run
one triage task that produces a reproduction and no PR.

### M3 — Repository skills

- [ ] Miner: extract → cluster → verify, three bounded passes
- [ ] Evidence enforcement, confidence, candidate/active promotion UI
- [ ] `CONTEXT.md` injection per agent, 40-rule cap
- [ ] Incremental re-mine, 180-day decay

**Acceptance:** run N ≥ 10 comparable tasks with and without injected conventions on the same
repo; report review rounds to merge and first-round-acceptance rate for both. If the number
does not move, the feature is wrong and should be redesigned, not shipped.

### M4 — Memory and multi-agent coordination

- [ ] `memory` + `memory_vec`, verification-gated promotion, scope-filtered retrieval
- [ ] Memory inspector UI with per-entry delete
- [ ] `osade` CLI verbs + skill asset install
- [ ] Orchestrator agent with the synthetic home id
- [ ] Reviewer gateway: neutral home, hash-verified manifest, structured artifact, gated post

**Acceptance:** an orchestrator agent decomposes one issue into three tasks by calling the
`osade` CLI, and a reviewer agent reviews a PR without ever having credentials or the source
checkout in its working directory.

### M5 — Org workspaces and cross-repo

- [ ] Org grouping, multi-repo ledger
- [ ] Cross-repo dependency links, ecosystem-tagged memory transfer
- [ ] Network egress enforcement
- [ ] Optional: AO-style lane↔chat handoff for agents whose resume id provably names the same
      conversation as their protocol session id. **Capability-gated.** Do not attempt this
      before M5; it needs CAS-fenced generations, drain policies, and a durable outbox to be
      correct, and it is worthless if done approximately.

## 22. Metrics

Instrument from M1. These are the only numbers that matter.

| Metric | Definition | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Review rounds to merge** | count of `changes_requested` events before merge | the §0.1 goal, directly |
| First-round acceptance | merged with zero changes requested | the strong version of the same thing |
| Human-touch minutes per merged PR | wall-clock in gate + review UI | what a maintainer actually spends |
| Verification catch rate | failures caught locally ÷ (local + CI) | value of the loop before it costs anyone |
| Gate denial rate | denied ÷ requested, per gate | a high rate means the agent is misjudging; a near-zero rate means the gate is theater |
| Convention hit rate | active rules cited in review comments after injection | is the miner mining the right things |
| Time to first meaningful output | task create → first verified diff | |

## 23. Open questions — decide before the milestone that needs them

1. **Embeddings.** Local (a small ONNX model, no network, works offline) or an API? Local is
   more consistent with local-first and avoids a key requirement for a core feature. Needed by
   M4.
2. **Which repos are the test bed?** The M3 measurement needs repos where you can actually see
   merge outcomes. `langchain-ai/deepagents` and `supabase/mcp` are candidates given prior
   contributions. Decide by M2 so mining can start early.
3. **Do triage tasks announce themselves?** If a triage artifact is posted to an issue,
   disclosure ("produced by an agent, verified by <human>") is both an ethical and a practical
   question — several projects now require it. Recommend: always disclose, and make the
   disclosure line non-editable.
4. **Windows.** the substrate supports it (ConPTY, named pipes, no live handoff). Osade v1 could be
   Unix-only to halve the surface. Decide before M0 ends, because the supervisor and socket
   code differ. *2026-09-04: the whole M0 path is verified working on Windows 11 —
   named-pipe JSON API from Node, headless server, worktrees, `agent.start`, status stream.
   The argument for going Unix-only is weaker than when this question was written.*
5. ~~**Surface renderer performance.** If the canvas renderer cannot hold 15 panes at 60fps,
   take the `TerminalAnsi` + xterm.js fallback.~~
   **Closed 2026-09-04 per PRD-DELTA #3.** The fallback does not exist — `TerminalAnsi` is
   negotiated only on the substrate's private `TerminalHello` path and endpoint shells are hardcoded
   to `SemanticFrame`. The question is moot for M0 because §4.4 defers the embedded terminal
   entirely. It returns at the M1 gate, and the target must then be re-derived in *tabs*, not
   panes: a connection renders one composited tab, so "15 panes" was never the unit.

## 25. The one-paragraph summary for a reviewer

Osade runs several coding agents as open-source contributors on real repositories. the substrate, an
existing Rust terminal workspace manager, is the execution substrate — it owns the PTYs, panes,
git worktrees, agent process detection and hook integrations, and it survives the app closing.
A new Node daemon owns everything the substrate has no concept of: tasks, the contribution lifecycle,
GitHub facts, verification runs, approval gates, mined repository conventions, and layered
memory. An Electron app renders it, taking domain state from the daemon and terminal cell
surfaces straight from the substrate. The load-bearing design choice, taken from AO, is that no status
is ever stored — every state the user sees is a pure function over durable facts recomputed at
read time, which is what keeps a flaky probe from killing a live agent. The load-bearing
product choice is that the goal is not more agent pull requests but a lower review cost per
contribution, which is why verification, evidence-cited conventions, scoped reviewer
confinement, and human gates on every public write are core rather than optional.
