 * OSADE.md §6 — THE core invariant.
 *
 * Status is a pure function over facts, recomputed on every read. It is never stored, never
 * cached in the database, and never sent from the client. This is AO's central invariant and
 * the single most important rule in the project: it is what stops a flaky probe from killing a
 * live agent, and what stops the ledger from drifting out of sync with reality.
 *
 * Pure. No I/O. No clock reads except the injected `now`.
 *
 * Rows are evaluated in order and the first match wins. The order is deliberate — see the
 * table in §6. Do not reorder without changing the spec first.
