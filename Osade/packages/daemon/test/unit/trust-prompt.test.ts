 * §8.3 — reading the trust prompt's selection.
 *
 * This function decides whether Osade is about to press Enter on "Yes, I trust this folder" or
 * on "No, exit". Getting it wrong once already cost a launch: a dropped `Down` keystroke left
 * the default selected, `Enter` declined the folder, and Claude quit — which surfaced as an
 * intermittent 90-second timeout rather than as what it was.
